## Task

For this project we were tasked with testing [the PetStore API](https://petstore3.swagger.io/), specifically testing all the data in the response for at least three different endpoints.

## Setup/Usage Instructions

To use the test framework, you will need to create a config.properties file as below:
```properties
api_key=<your api key>
api_url=<base url>
```
and put it in `src/test/resources`
